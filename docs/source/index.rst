`BioNetGen <https://bionetgen.org/>`_ is software designed for modular, structure-based modeling of biochemical reaction networks.
It can be applied to many other types of modeling as well.
It provides a simple, graph-based syntax that lets users build reaction models out of structured objects that can bind and undergo modification.

Under the **Contents** directory below, you will find more information about the current software for rule-based modeling in BioNetGen.
The **VS Code BNGL extension** includes many helpful features, including a GUI, to aid in using BioNetGen in the VS Code editor.
**PyBioNetGen** provides a lightweight CLI and Python library for programmatic manipulation of BioNetGen models.
Installation instructions for both can be found at the link below.

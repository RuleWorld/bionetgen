'''''2015 March 3'''''

==== New Features ====

===== SBML-to-BNGL Translator =====
* The SBML-to-BNGL translator can perform both a flat (one-to-one) translation 
of an SBML model in terms of unstructured species and an "atomized" translation 
that recovers the implicit molecular structure (binding sites and states) of the 
species within the model. The translator can be accessed in the following three ways:
# Using the readFile() BioNetGen action: The 'atomize' argument specifies whether a 
flat or atomized translation is to be performed (default is flat, i.e., 
atomize). The translated model is written to [sbml_filename].bngl, 
which is then read and loaded into memory. This allows additional actions [e.g., simulate(), 
parameter_scan()] to be performed on the model if desired.  See the 
[[BioNetGen_Actions_and_Arguments | BioNetGen Actions & Arguments Guide]] for a comprehensive 
listing of all actions and arguments, including readFile().
# Running the [BNGPATH]/bin/sbmlTranslator executable directly: 
This provides the functionality described above along with additional customization flags. 
Run ./sbmlTranslator --help> for a complete list of options with descriptions.
# As a standalone web application at [http://ratomizer.appspot.com/translate http://ratomizer.appspot.com/translate].

For further information, see the SBML-to-BNGL documentation.

===== Visualization Tools =====
* Visualization tools can be accessed by calling the visualize() action in a BNGL model file 
or running the visualize.pl script included in 
[BNGPATH]/Perl2/Visualization. The output is generated in Graph Modeling 
Language (GML) format, which can be processed by graph editors such as yEd 
([http://www.yworks.com/yed www.yworks.com/yed]) and Cytoscape 
([http://www.cytoscape.org www.cytoscape.org]). Currently supported visualizations are:
** Model visualization as a contact map: >visualize({type=>"contactmap"})
** Model visualization as a regulatory graph: visualize({type=>"regulatory"})
** Rule visualization as a Petri net: visualize({type=>"ruleviz_pattern"})
** Rule visualization using graph operations: visualize({type=>"ruleviz_operation"})

For further information, call visualize({help=>1}) or run ./visualize.pl --help.

===== Actions & Arguments =====
* Added a 'reset_conc' argument to parameter_scan() that suppresses the call to resetConcentrations() 
if set to 0 (default value is 1). This allows simulations in the scan to be started from the end point 
of the previous simulation (used in bifurcate(); see below).
* Added a new bifurcate() action that takes the same arguments as parameter_scan() (except 'reset_conc'). 
The method automatically runs two scans, one from 'par_min' to 'par_max' and the other in the reverse 
direction. Each simulation in the scans starts from the end point of the previous simulation by passing 
<big><tt>reset_conc=>0</tt></big> to parameter_scan(). Output files are then generated for each observable 
containing the parameter values vs. final observable values for both forward and reverse directions.
* Modified readFile() to allow specific model blocks to be read using the 'blocks' argument.
** Example: <big><tt>readFile({file=>"mymodel.bngl",blocks=>["parameters","seed species"]})</tt></big>
* Added support for <big><tt>method=>"nf"</tt></big> in simulate(). This allows NFsim to be used in 
parameter_scan() and bifurcate() as well.
* Added support for compartments in writeSBML() and upgraded the supported version of SBML to Level 2 Version 3.

==== Minor Changes ====
* Upgraded muParser ([http://muparser.beltoforion.de http://muparser.beltoforion.de]) to version 2.2.4.
* Modified parameter_scan() to set <big><tt>get_final_state=>0</tt></big> if <big><tt>reset_conc=>1</tt></big> 
(the default). This prevents BNG from unnecessarily reading in the final species populations at the end of 
NFsim simulations if they are going to be reset anyway. This is important as the read step can be extremely 
expensive for models with high degrees of symmetry.
* Modified setConcentration() to retain parameter names in expressions (rather than evaluating to a number). 
This allows setConcentration() to be used with parameter_scan(). However, observables and functions are 
still evaluated to numbers.
* Modified NET file output to list all rules that generate a given reaction in the comment following each 
line of the <big><tt>reactions</tt></big> block. This is useful when a reaction is generated by multiple 
different rules. Often this is unintentional and can be problematic since BNG multiplies the rate constant 
by the number of duplicates generated. Listing all rules that generate a reaction can help identify and 
debug situations like this.
* Added a default PLA configuration for <big><tt>simulate(method=>"pla")</tt></big>. If the 'pla_config' 
argument is not defined, the configuration is set to <big><tt>fEuler|pre-neg:sb|eps=0.03</tt></big>, i.e., 
a standard tau-leaping method (1st order) with species-based preleap tau calculations, negative-population 
postleap checking, and error control parameter 'eps' of 0.03.
* Modified <big><tt>validate_examples.pl</tt></big> to only report a stochastic validation failure if the 
validation fails twice in a row.
* Added functionality to readFile() to convert forward slashes (/) to back slashes (\), and vice versa, 
in '''''relative''''' paths, depending on the OS. This improves cross-platform portability and makes it 
easier to share models.

==== Bug Fixes ====
* An error is now thrown if zero-order synthesis products do not have compartments.
* BNG will no longer switch to "compartmental" mode if the <big><tt>compartments</tt></big> block is empty.
* Expressions for compartment volumes are now correctly evaluated when generating a BNG-XML file.
* Fixed an inconsistency where forward referencing of parameters/observables was allowed for functions 
defined in the <big><tt>functions</tt></big> block but not in the <big><tt>reaction rules</tt></big> block. 
* Fixed a bug where in rare cases a function defined in the <big><tt>reaction rules</tt></big> block would 
be typed as a 'ConstantExpression'. This would cause simulation to fail since it would be placed in the 
<big><tt>parameters</tt></big> block of the generated NET file.
* Fixed a bug in the handling of 'max_stoich' constraints. In versions 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.2.5, the 
constraints were sometimes ignored during network generation and complexes larger than the maximum 
specified could be constructed. Also added code to check that molecule names passed in the argument are 
valid. This is useful since users often specify patterns, such as 'A()', rather than the actual molecule 
name 'A'. Without an error message this can cause confusion.
* Fixed a bug where BNG was not passing to NFsim the random seed that it was generating when the 'seed' 
argument was not explicitly set by the user. This made it difficult to debug problems in NFsim since it 
was not outputting a random seed in the error messages.

== BioNetGen-2.2.5-stable ==
'''''2013 July 30'''''

==== New Features ====

===== BioNetGen-to-MCell Converter =====
The converter creates spatial MCell models from BioNetGen. It is called 
by adding "<big><tt>writeMDL()</tt></big>" to the actions of a BioNetGen 
model file. It also requires a geometry input file externally created using 
CellBlender, an addon to the Blender software for creating MCell geometries. 
Execution of a BioNetGen model integrates the reaction network and geometry 
information and creates a MCell model file (.mdl). Alternatively,
"writeMDL()" enables direct execution and import of BioNetGen models from 
CellBlender. The imported BioNetGen model can be integrated with geometries 
created in CellBlender and exported from CellBlender as MCell model files. 

===== AutoHPP =====
AutoHPP automates the construction and simulation of Hybrid Particle/Population
systems. AutoHPP profiles species populations during a test simulation,
identifies species with average population graater than a threshold, and then
constructs and simulates an HPP system where the identified species are treated
as lumped populations. Auto HPP is implemented in the "auto_hpp.pl" script
found in the "Perl2" subfolder (requires NFsim).

==== Minor changes ====
* If "BNG2.pl" is called without a model argument, the help menu is printed to
STDOUT. (In prior releases, BNG2.pl exited silently.)
* When parsing a global function ratelaw, BNG will not create a reference to
the function in the parameter table unless the function call is part of an
inline math expression. (Note that use of inline expressions within ratelaws is 
advised against, since this is not supported by NFsim.)
* Modified the behavior of the '<big><tt>prefix</tt></big>' argument. Previously,
the argument was assumed to be an absolute path. Now, it is checked using 
<big><tt>File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute()</tt></big> to determine whether or
not it is an absolute path. If it is not an absolute path, then the output 
directory remains the current working directory and only the model name is 
modified.

==== Bug Fixes ====
* Fixed bug in Network3 code that caused an error if an "if()" function was used 
in the <big><tt>parameters</tt></big> block. This situation arises when a local 
function is defined that includes an "if()" function. Thus, logical local functions 
are now supported for network simulations.
* Fixed bug that caused simulations of HPP models containing global functions
to fail after loading from file. The problem was fixed by tracking global
functions directly rather than creating a reference in the parameter table.
* Fixed "--check" command line option (i.e., parse model, but do not execute
actions). 

== BioNetGen-2.2.4-stable ==
'''''2013 May 16'''''

==== Errata ====
'''''2013 July 30''''' A bug was discovered in the handling of max_stoich
constraints. In some cases, the constraints will be ignored during network
generation, and complexes larger than the maximum specified may be constructed.
(Fixed in 2.2.6)

'''''2013 July 24''''' The "--check" command line switch is broken in this
version. BNG will parse the model and execute actions regardless of the switch.

'''''2013 July 22''''' HPP models with global functions fail to simulate in
NFsim after loading from file. The problem can be circumvented by simulating
the HPP model immediately after construction by passing the "execute=>1"
argument to "generate_hybrid_model()".

==== New Features ====

===== Modular model source files =====
BNG now supports multiple and recursive calls of the readFile() action. This
allows modular assembly of BNGL models from multiple source files. For example,
the model definitions can be stored in one file and parameter values in
a second file.

==== Changes to BNG action commands ====
* Complex bookkeeping option, "complex", is now enabled by default in the
simulate_nf() action, i.e. "complex=>1".
* Default value for option 'get_final_state' for simulate_nf() action has been
changed to TRUE. Consequently, the final state of a NF simulation will be
loaded into the BNG by default. However, to avoid the ''slow'' process of
canonically labeling massive complexes, any species composed of more than
20 molecules will be labeled using a quasi-canonical method. If this is still
too slow, set the option to FALSE (0).

==== New Example and Validation Models ====
* Added catalysis.bngl to Models2 directory. This model demonstrates
the implementation of energy consuming reactions in energy BNGL.

==== Bug Fixes ====
* Fixed minor bug that caused unnecessary retention of temporary labels in HPP
rules. This bug did not cause errors per se, but did result in a lot of
unnecessary warning messages.
* Fixed minor bug in HNauty labeling method that led to failure for species
graphs with bond wildcards. Note that this bug only affected pattern labels
(used in HPP) and not proper species.

==== Code refactoring ====
* Command line argument parsing in BNG2.pl is now handled by the core
module GetOpts::Long. This change should result in more robust parsing and
reduced maintaince in the future.

== BioNetGen-2.2.4-testing ==
'''''2013 March 31'''''

==== Errata ====
'''''2013 July 30''''' A bug was discovered in the handling of max_stoich
constraints. In some cases, the constraints will be ignored during network
generation, and complexes larger than the maximum specified may be constructed.
(Fixed in 2.2.6)

'''''2013 April 10''''' The original release notes for 2.2.4-testing stated that
the simulate_nf() action enabled complex bookkeeping by default. However, the
implementation of this change was flawed! 2.2.4-testing still defaults to
complex bookkeeping disabled. To enable complex bookkeeping, add the option
"complex=>1". This will be corrected in the next release.

'''''2013 April 10''''' The original release notes for 2.2.4-testing stated that
the time() function is available for use in any math expression. This is
incorrect. The time() function is only available in math expressions defined
in the functions block of BNGL model.

==== Hardware and Operating System Support ====

===== Mac OS/X run_network executable is now compiled for x86_64 =====
The run_network Mac executable distributed with BioNetGen was previously
compiled for i686 architecture (32-bit). In this and future distributions,
Mac OS/X executables will be compiled for x86_64 (64-bit). If a 32-bit
executable is required, browse to the "Network3" subdirectory and follow the
compilation instructions.

==== New Features ====

===== Empty species symbol "0" supported for compartmental BNGL =====
We introduced the new symbol "0" in 2.2.3 for representing an empty
pattern or species. This is useful anywhere BNG expects a pattern or
species but the modeler wants the empty set. For example, "0" may be
used on the LHS of a reaction rule for zero-order synthesis, or
the RHS for degradation rules. This feature is now supported in
compartmental BNGL

'''''NOTE:''''' compartmental BNGL adopts the convention that zero order
synthesis rate constants are given as intensive units (conc/time or
counts/vol/time). Hence, the total rate of synthesis depends on the rate
constant AND the volume of the compartment.

===== Energy BNGL (testing) =====
Energy modeling is a new approach to rule-based modeling where
kinetics are derived from changes in free-energy and activation barriers.
This approach was pioneered by J. Ollivier, et al. (PLoS Comp. Bio. 2010)
and generalized by Vincent Danos. Energy modeling has a number of advantages,
including: detailed balance is guaranteed, reaction rules are simplified,
and allostery/cooperativity easily implemented. A simple example of energy
modeling, 'energy_example1.bngl' was added to the Models2 directory. Keep an
eye out for more documentation and examples of energy modeling in BNG.

===== Time-dependent functions (testing) =====
Implemented a special function "time()" that refers to the current time 
in a simulation. The time function may be used
in any mathematical expression. '''''CORRECTION:''''' ''The time() function is
only recognized in math expressions defined in the functions block.'' This is
useful for ratelaws or events that depend on time. Time is recognized by
run_network but not (presently) by NFsim. 

'''''CAUTION:''''' Discontinuities in ratelaws may cause problems for
ODE integrators. If a timed event causes a discrete change
in a ratelaw, it is best to stop and restart the simulator.

'''''CAUTION:''''' Time-dependent rates in SSA simulations may introduce
substantial error if the relative rate change is fast in time. Advanced
methods exist for managing time-dependent rates accurately; however,
these methods are not currently implemented in run_network.

===== Molecule-scoped local functions =====
Added support for local functions evaluated on the scope of a tagged
molecule. This feature was already supported by NFsim, but is now
available for network generation and network simulation. See the NFsim
manual (chapter 7) for examples of molecule-scoped local functions.

==== Improvements to Existing Features ====

===== On-the-fly network generation is fixed =====
Run_network supports on-the-fly network generation again. However, the
implementation is not very efficient. NFsim is recommended for 
applications with large networks.

===== Added support for functional rate laws in SBML export =====
Fixed SBML export for functional rate laws. Global functions are now
output in the same way as parameter expressions. Local functions are NOT
output to SBML because they are evaluated down to a number by BNG during
network generation so they're unnecessary. Note that the "Group_" prefix
has been removed from the SBML IDs of observables so that they can be
easily referenced in function expressions. This is not a problem because
parameters and observables occupy the same namespace so there is no
possibility of conflicts.

===== Better handling of mathematical expression in output =====
BioNetGen now exports mathematical expressions by default, rather than
evaluating to a number. This preserves the original math when models or
networks are written to file. Support for mathematical expressions in the
parameters block was added to run_network.

===== Upgrades to MATLAB export via writeMfile() =====
* Improved error capture when calling MATLAB's ODE23s integrator.
* Support for "if" functions: "if(cond,val1,val2)" is translated
to "(cond~=0)*val1 + (cond==0)*val2". This isn't a perfect solution since it
requires that val1 and val2 both evaluate to finite numbers. Unfortunately,
MATLAB does not support the ternary conditional (a better solution).
* Eliminated redundancy of expression evaluation, resulting in better 
run-time efficiency.

==== Bug Notices ====
* run_network fails to parse math expressions properly if a parameter name in
the expression begins with a number. We recommend that parameter names begin
with a letter character. Parameter names beginning with numbers will likely
be deprecated in a future release.

==== Bug Fixes ====
* Fixed bug where parameters beginning with "and" or "or" were confused
with the logical operations. The problem was traced to the muParser
library. Upgrading to muParser v2.2.3 solved this problem.
* Fixed bug where setConcentration (and potentially other actions) fail to
parse arguments that contain species definitions with compartmental syntax.
* Fixed bug in BNG math expression parser where unary operators were parsed
incorrectly in some circumstances.
* Fixed bug where run_network reported incorrect line number in error message.
* Fixed potential bug in isomorphic detection method, where BNG attempts to
access undefined nodes if graphs have unequal size. This is prevented by
checking the size of the graphs prior to comparison.
* Fixed bug that caused generate_network() action to return an error if no
seed species are defined. This fix permits network generation for models with
0-order synthesis but no seed species.
* Fixed bug where scan_var.pl generated invalid scripts if the BNGL model file
does not end with a new line.
* Fixed bug where functions comprised of more than 512 characters could not 
be read. There is now no limit to the number of characters.

==== Minor Syntax Changes ====
* Deprecated use of fixed quantity flag "$"  within reactant rules.
The fixed quantity flag should only be used in the seed species block.
* Use of "fake" species such as "NULL", "TRASH", or "SINK" as placeholders
in reaction rules with zero reactants and products is now deprecated.
We advise the use of the special symbol "0" instead.
* Labels are now permitted before definitions in all BNGL blocks.

==== Changes to BNG action commands ====
* Added 'continue' option to generate_network() action. If this option
is enabled, BNG will continue generating a network from the last
completed iteration. If disabled, BNG will start reset the network
and generate from scratch. The option is enabled by default, i.e.'continue=>1'.
* Complex bookkeeping option, 'complex', is now enabled by default in the
simulate_nf() action, i.e. 'complex=>1'. '''''CORRECTION:''''' ''The
implementation of this change was flawed. The 2.2.4-testing release still
defaults to complex bookkeeping disabled. To enable complex bookkeeping, add
the option complex=>1''.
* The 'exact' option for generate_hybrid_model() was renamed to 'safe'. This
avoids confusion over whether the standard method is exact. Indeed, both
methods are exact if population lumping is instantaneous. However, only
the 'safe' method is exact for finite lumping rates. The default is
'safe=>0'. The old 'exact' option will be supported up to (and including) the
next stable release.

==== Error and Warning Message Changes ====
* Useless {MatchOnce} attribute in species definitions are now detected and
reported.
* Improved detection of illegal dangling bonds and wildcards in reaction rules.
* Improved clarity of error messages for unrecognized BNG version strings
and missing ratelaw arguments.
* scan_var.pl utility reports an error is the BNGL model does not contain an
"end model" directive.
* run_network will now allow commented lines in the functions block of the
NET file.
* run_network no longer complains is there are no parameters in the model.

==== New Example and Validation Models ====
* Added gene_expr_func.bngl and localfunc.bngl to Models2 directory.
NOTE: these models were previous distributed as validation models.
* A simple example of energy modeling, 'energy_example1.bngl' was added to
the Models2 directory.
* Adding two new validation files: (1) isingspin_energy.bngl implements an
ising spin model on a 3x3 toroidal lattice using the energy approach, (2)
isingspin_localfcn.bngl implements the ising spin model (same topology) using
local functions. Both models test the SSA equillibrium distribution. Model 2
also tests the NF equillibrium distribution.  NOTE: the energy approach is
not supported in NFsim, hence this version won't scale to a larger lattice.

==== Code refactoring ====
* Enabled strict and warning pragmas in BNGModel.pm
* Migrated to muParser 2.2.3 (from v134) for parsing math expressions in
run_network. Implemented a static "If()" function in network.h that gets
called as "if()" in muParser [parser.DefineFun("if",If) in
network::read_functions_array()]. This should solve the problem of if()
being deprecated in the muparser_v2_2_3. Also modified run_network.cpp and
network.cpp to no longer replace "&&" with "and" and "||" with "or".
* Reformulated generate_network so that observables and energy patterns are
updated as species are generated, rather than after an iteration of
network generation completes.
* The Expression type "FUN" was renamed as "FunctionCall". The original type
name caused some confusion as to whether the expression was a function
definition or a function call. To clarify, the type was renamed FunctionCall.
The Function object holds the definition (RHS) for a function. For further
reference: the Param type Function associates a name to a Function object.
A function without an associated Param is anonymous (i.e. cannot be found in
the ParamList).

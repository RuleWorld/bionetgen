Installation procedure for SBMLParser

Prerequisites
-------------
SBMLParser is a tool written in Python 2.7. The following libraries are needed in order to build the binary from scratch:

* numpy 1.8.0 or greater
* scipy  0.12.0 or greater
* libsbml 5.10.0  or greater (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), with python bindings (can be installed using "pip install python-libsbml")
* pandas for BioGrid functionality (http://pandas.pydata.org/)

Build instructions for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin:

* make
* make install

This will place a binary called 'sbmlTranslator' in the 'bin' directory inside the BioNetGen main directory.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Bootloader related errors:

* Prebuilt bootloaders for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin are included in the BioNetGen distribution. 
However, if your platform is not supported by the bootloaders we have bundled, it is necessary to 
create a custom one. To do so, in a command prompt navigate to 'pyinstaller2/bootloader' and execute:

  ./waf configure build install

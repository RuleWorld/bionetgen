Installation procedure for SBMLParser

Prerequisites
-------------
SBMLParser is a tool written in Python 2.7. The following libraries are needed in order to build the binary from scratch:

* numpy 1.8.0 or greater (can be installed through pip install numpy)
* libsbml 5.10.0  or greater (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/Downloading_libSBML), with python bindings (can be installed using "pip install python-libsbml". SBML has some dependencies of its own, check the libSBML page linked above for more details)

Build instructions for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin:

* make
* make install

This will place a binary called 'sbmlTranslator' in the 'bin' directory inside the BioNetGen main directory.

Build instructions for Windows

* In addition to the Python packages listed above, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package is also required.
* "pip install python-libsbml" may not work windows installed python. 
* You can manually download it from (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/libsbml-downloading.html)

* powershell.exe -nologo -noprofile -command "& { Add-Type -A 'System.IO.Compression.FileSystem'; [IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory('pyinstaller2.zip', 'pyinstaller2'); }"
* python updateDistribution.py -c
* python pyinstaller2\pyinstaller.py sbmlTranslator_windows.spec
* copy dist\sbmlTranslator.exe ..\bin\sbmlTranslator.exe


Troubleshooting
---------------
Bootloader related errors:

* Prebuilt bootloaders for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin are included in the BioNetGen distribution. 
However, if your platform is not supported by the bootloaders we have bundled, it is necessary to 
create a custom one. To do so, in a command prompt navigate to 'pyinstaller2/bootloader' and execute:

  ./waf configure build install

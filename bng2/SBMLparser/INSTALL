Installation procedure for SBMLParser

Prerequisites
-------------
SBMLParser is a tool written in Python 2.7. The following libraries are needed in order to build the binary from scratch:

* numpy 1.8.0 or greater (can be installed through pip install numpy)
* libsbml 5.10.0  or greater (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), with python bindings (can be installed using "pip install python-libsbml")

Additionally you also need libblas and liblapack. This libraries are automatically installed by most package managers when
you install scipy, but if you are installing manually make sure you install these.

Build instructions for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin:

* make
* make install

This will place a binary called 'sbmlTranslator' in the 'bin' directory inside the BioNetGen main directory.

Build instructions for Windows

* In addition to the Python packages listed above, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package is also required.
* "pip install python-libsbml" may not work windows installed python. 
* You can manually download it from (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/libsbml-downloading.html)

* powershell.exe -nologo -noprofile -command "& { Add-Type -A 'System.IO.Compression.FileSystem'; [IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory('pyinstaller2.zip', 'pyinstaller2'); }"
* python updateDistribution.py -c
* python pyinstaller2\pyinstaller.py sbmlTranslator_windows.spec
* copy dist\sbmlTranslator.exe ..\bin\sbmlTranslator.exe


Troubleshooting
---------------
Bootloader related errors:

* Prebuilt bootloaders for Linux/MacOSX/Windows-Cygwin are included in the BioNetGen distribution. 
However, if your platform is not supported by the bootloaders we have bundled, it is necessary to 
create a custom one. To do so, in a command prompt navigate to 'pyinstaller2/bootloader' and execute:

  ./waf configure build install

# BioNetGen Tutorial

The files presented here are meant to provide a moderately paced but comprehensive introduction to the syntax and features of the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and modeling software. These examples can be run either using `BNG2.pl` from the command line or using the VS Code extension/PyBioNetGen.  

**Click on the link to see the BNGL code, which can be copy/pasted into a .bngl file in an editor, such as VS Code.**

## Basic structure and syntax
[`ABC.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABC/ABC.bngl)
: Simple binding model in BNGL using unstructured molecules to represent each species. Demonstrates basic syntax of `simulate` command.

[`ABC_scan.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABC/ABC_scan.bngl)
: Simple binding model modified to use`parameters` block, which enables `parameter_scan`. Also demonstrates use of `#` for comments and `\` for line continuation.

[`ABC_ssa.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABC/ABC_ssa.bngl)
: Simple binding model with modifed `method` option to `simulate` command to demonstrate `ssa` method for performing stochastic simulation.

[`LV.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABC/LV.bngl)
: Lotka-Volterra model in BioNetGen syntax.

[`SIR.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABC/SIR.bngl)
: Basic disease outbreak model used in 2020 Workshop Tutorial

## Using structured molecules and rules: Binding
[`AB.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/AB/AB.bngl)
: Simple binding model re-factored to used structured molecules with binding sites and a binding rule that adds or deletes a bond.

[`BAB.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/BAB/BAB.bngl)
: Simple binding model with a bivalent A molecule that has two identical sites for binding of B. Binding at each site is not affected by the status of the other site (noncooperative binding). Things to notice:
* This is a good model to examine the output of network generation, which is found in the file `BAB.net` that is generated by BioNetGen. In this file the `seed species` block is converted to a `species` block, which lists all of the species that result from network generation. The `reaction rules` block is replaced by `reactions`, and the `observables` block is replaced by `groups`. In these blocks species strings are replaced by an index referring to entries in the `species` block. Both rate constants in reactions and entries in `groups` can be preceded by an integer that specifies a pre-factor arising from *symmetry* or *multiplicity*.

[`BAB_scan.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/BAB/BAB_scan.bngl)
: Varying the amount of A reveals nonmonotonic behavior of complexation. This example demonstrates use of the `log_scale` option to `parameter_scan`. Things to notice:
* To observe the behavior of the BAB complex, you will have to turn off display of the other, more abundant observables.
* You will also need to change the X Axis scale from `linear` to `log`.

## Using structured molecules and rules: Component state change

[`ABp.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABp/ABp.bngl)
: Simple enzyme binding and substrate modification scheme. A is a kinase and B contains a phosphorylable substrate site called `Y`, which has two states, `0` and `P`, which represent the unphosphorylated state and phosphorylated states respectively. This model also demonstrates the use of expressions in the `parameters` block to perform unit conversions and comments to define a consistent set of units. We recommend cubic microns (fL) as the standard volume unit, µM or molecule counts for concentration, µm for length, and µm<sup>2</sup> for area.

[`ABp_approx.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABp/ABp_approx.bngl)
: A simplified version of the A-B phosphorylation model in which the explicit binding of A and B is eliminated and the phosphorylation reaction rate is given by the Michaelis-Menten rate law. 

**Exercise:** Try changing the initial amounts of A and B such that A is in ten-fold excess over B and plotting the resulting time courses. What do you observe? (*Hint: Be sure to change the duration of the simulation as well.*)

[More advanced models of substrate modification dynamics](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/ABp/AdvancedModels.md). Demonstrates additional use of functions in rate laws, how to define a simulation protocol using multiple `simulate` commands and the `setParameter` command, and use of the `bifurcate` command to examine a bistable system. 

## Modeling synthesis and degradation 

[`birth-death.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/SynDeg/birtgh-death.bngl)
: Simple model illustrating synthesis and degradation of molecules. Also, demonstrates use of `saveConcentrations()` and `resetConcentrations()` to save and restore initial conditions and to compare model simulated with two different methods. Introduces `generate_network()` command.

[`toggle.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/SynDeg/toggle.bngl)
: Simple model of a two-gene toggle switch describing the synthetic circuit of Gardner, Cantor, and Collins. Demonstrates use of the `bifurcate()` command to identify hysteresis loops in a potentially bistable system. Model also demonstrates stochastic transitions between metastable states that could represent cell phenotypes.

**Exercise:** Make a simple model of an auto-regulating gene in which the gene product P dimerizes and binds to the promoter to block transcription. 

[`ComplexDegradation.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/SynDeg/ComplexDegradation.bngl)
: Demonstrates behavior of various rules specifying degradation of complexes and how this can be controlled by the `DeleteMolecules` keyword.

**Exercise:** Modify the model you made in the previous exercise to allow degradation of P even when it's bound to DNA without degrading the DNA.

## Ligand-receptor binding models

These models address issues of unit definition, how to construct models with distinct spatial compartments, and using network-free simulation for models that have a large or potentially infinite number of possible species and reactions.
See the [Quick Reference Guide](https://github.com/RuleWorld/bionetgen/blob/master/docs/QRG-30Mar2016.pdf) for a brief introduction to the Compartment specification and syntax.

[`LR.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/LR.bngl)
: Non-compartmental model of simple ligand-receptor binding.

[`LR_comp.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/LR_comp.bngl)
: Compartmental model of simple ligand-receptor binding.

[`LRR.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/LRR.bngl)
: Non-compartmental model of ligand-receptor binding and dimerization. Also demonstrates `visualize` command to make `.gml` files for visualization of the rule network using the external tool [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/yed).

[`LRR_comp.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/LRR_comp.bngl)
: Compartmental model of ligand-receptor binding and dimerization.

[`BLBR.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/BLBR.bngl)
: Bivalent ligand - bivalent receptor (BLBR) model, which is a simple model of polymer formation by receptors that can form a chain with infinite length (in the continuum limit). Simulating this model using a generate and simulate approach is problematic because for these parameters the required network of complexes is very large. Using network-free simulation addresses this problem.

## Models for CellBlender

*As of March 7, 2018 the SBML importer in CellBlender does not create the objects corresponding to the specified compartments. These have to be constructed manually in CellBlender.*

[`organelle_transport.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/organelle_transport.bngl)
: Simple model of tranport involving two cell organelles. This model is used in the CellBlender tutorial. The model exported in SBML format can be imported into CellBlender by selecting File->Import->BioNetGen/SBML model (.bngl,.xml)

[`organelle_transport_struct.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/organelle_transport_struct.bngl)
: Equivalent version of organelle transport model using structured molecules.

[`LV_comp.bngl`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/CBNGL/LV_comp.bngl)
: Lotka-Volterra model in compartmental form for export to CellBlender. NOTE: The third reaction needs to be modified to set the product to `NULL`.

: Input file that can be used to translate an SBML file (with .xml extension) into a BNGL model. The `atomize` parameter determines whether the translated will be structured (`atomize=>1`) or unstructured (`atomize=>0`). "Structured" here means that the translator will attempt to determine the underlying molecules, components, bonds, and states. Some example SBML input models are [here](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/SBML/). A repository of SBML models is available at [biomodels.net](http://biomodels.net). Be sure to download models with annotation (usually SBML Level 2).

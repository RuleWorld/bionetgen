# Software that Uses BioNetGen
This page links to other software that use BioNetGen code or BNGL-formatted models. *Note: This list is a work in progress and may not be complete.*

## Software
| Software | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [AMICI](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) | Provides an interface to the CVODES and IDAS solvers for models specified in SBML or [PySB](https://pysb.org/), both of which are capable of representing BNGL models |
| [BioSimulators](https://biosimulators.org/)| Provides a registry of biosimulation tools supporting many different model formats, including BNGL |
| [BioUML](https://www.biouml.org/) |  |
| [Kappa](https://kappalanguage.org/) | Another prominent rule-based modeling language |
| [MCell](https://mcell.org/) | Uses 3D cellular models and Monte Carlo algorithms for simulating the movements and reactions of molecules within and between cells; the latest version of MCell, MCell4, uses BNGL |
| [ML-Rules](https://git.informatik.uni-rostock.de/mosi/mlrules2) |  |
| [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/) |  |
| [NFsim](http://michaelsneddon.net/nfsim/) |  |
| [NFsim](http://michaelsneddon.net/nfsim/) | Biochemical reaction simulator designed to handle large numbers of possible molecular interactions or states; uses BNGL for model specification |
| [Parts&Pools]() |  |
| [PyBioNetFit](https://bionetfit.nau.edu/) | Provides a suite of algorithms for parameterizing models specified in BNGL or SBML |
| [PySB](https://pysb.org/) | Allows for building models of biochemical systems as Python programs; internally translates Python code into BNGL or Kappa rules |
| [SBML_Multi]() |  |
| [Smoldyn](https://www.smoldyn.org/) | Performs cell-scale biochemical simulations; can perform rule-based modeling using either its native wildcards or by running BioNetGen on BNGL files |
| [SPATKIN](https://pmbm.ippt.pan.pl/web/Spatkin) |  |
| [SRSim](https://www.biosys.uni-jena.de/Members/Gerd+Gruenert/SRSim.html) |  |
| [VirtualCell](https://vcell.org/bionetgen/) |  |
